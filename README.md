ETS2/ATS Local Radio plays radio from where you are, in ETS2. Feel the immersion when the Swedish radio plays in Sweden, and the Polish radio in Poland. It will switch automatically, while also allowing you to switch stations while driving.

ATS/ETS2 Local Radio contains over 9000 radio stations that you could realistically listen to if you were driving in that actual area.

- **Modern UI**: Complete redesign with Material Design 3
- **Lightweight**: Built with Tauri v2 (Rust) instead of .NET
- **40+ Languages**: Full internationalization support
- **Improved Performance**: Better radio playback and volume control
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Supported Maps

**ETS2:** Default with all DLC, ProMods, ProMods Middle-East, RusMap.
**ATS:** Default with all DLC, Viva Mexico, Coast to Coast, Canadream.
Other maps that cover roughly the same area are likely to be supported as well.
